# Coursera-Machine-Learning-Programming-Programming-Exercise-6-Support-Vector-Machines
In this exercise, you will be using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics. To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to this directory before starting this exercise. You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the “Environment Setup Instructions” of the course website
